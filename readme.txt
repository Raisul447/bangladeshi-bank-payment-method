WooCommerce gateway for Bangladeshi businesses allowing customers to upload bank payment receipts at checkout.

== Description ==
This plugin adds a secure **Bank Payment with Receipt Upload** option to your WooCommerce store, specially designed for merchants and customers in Bangladesh.
Instead of just entering a transaction ID, customers can **upload a screenshot or photo of their bank payment receipt** (e.g., mobile banking confirmation) directly on the checkout page. The uploaded image is securely stored and displayed in the order details for easy manual verification by the store admin.

**Perfect for businesses that require visual proof of payment before processing orders.**

**Features:**
* Accept bank transfer payments from any Bangladeshi bank (City Bank, IFIC BANK, UCB Bank, Islami Bank etc.).
* Customers upload a **payment receipt image** (PNG/JPG) during checkout.
* Automatic file validation (max 500KB, only images allowed).
* Uploaded receipt is visible in the **WooCommerce order details** in the admin dashboard.
* Displays your bank account details clearly on the checkout page.
* Fully compatible with WooCommerce emails, order statuses, and cart flow.
* You can change your bank icon, it will make it visually clear and easier for customers to understand.
* No sensitive data stored — secure and lightweight.
