## 📖 Description
This plugin adds a secure Bank Payment with Receipt Upload option to your WooCommerce store, specially designed for merchants and customers in Bangladesh. Instead of just entering a transaction ID, customers can upload a screenshot or photo of their bank payment receipt (e.g., mobile banking confirmation) directly on the checkout page. The uploaded image is securely stored and displayed in the order details for easy manual verification by the store admin. This is perfect for businesses that require visual proof of payment before processing orders.
